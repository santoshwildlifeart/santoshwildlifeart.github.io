      <h1>Homepage - My Wildlife Art</h1>
      
      <p><em><mark>NOTE: This site is under construction and does not yet have most of its intended content or design. It will be finished 
      and the first dozen paintings uploaded by Christmas 2017, so if you have stumbled by here, please visit again in a month's time!</mark></em></p>
      
      <p>Welcome! This site is primarily for hosting my wildlife art in oils, watercolour, acrylic, pastel and pencil.
      My landscape paintings and botanical art will also be added in due course.</p>
      
      <p>My passion and aspiration are to express through painting the sense of beauty I perceive when confronted with Earth's wilderness and wildlife, 
      and to enable you to feel it too. A second but equally important desire is to contribute to wildlife conservation efforts worldwide 
      through sale proceeds from my art. To this end, 50% of the sale price of any of my paintings will be donated to a wildlife 
      conservation organisation. In this way I hope to repay in a small measure for the joy and beauty I have enjoyed from watching and 
      painting wildlife.</p>
      
      <p>You can access the main sections of the site through the menu above. The <em>Gallery</em> page collects all my wildlife paintings and new 
        addtions to this site are noted in the <em>What's new</em> page. You can also read more about me on the <em>About</em> page. Finally all my 
        non-wildlife art related interests are behind the <em>Other Interests</em> section.</p>
      
      <p>I hope this site and my paintings and drawings inspire you to feel the beauty of Earth's wildlife and the vital urgency to 
      cherish and protect it. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
