  <p class="txt">The yellow-rumped honeyguide <span class="txt-latname">Indicator xanthonotus</span> is a sparrow-sized bird in the honeyguide family that is 
    found in Asia, mainly in <em>montane forests along the Himalayas.</em> They are very finch-like but the feet are strong and zygodactyl, with two toes 
    facing forward and two backward. They perch on honeycombs and feed on wax. Males tend to be territorial and stay near honeycombs while females and 
    juveniles forage widely. They are <b>brood parasites,</b> laying their eggs in the nests of <a href="#">tree-hole breeders,</a> 
    <a href="#">possibly barbets.</a>
